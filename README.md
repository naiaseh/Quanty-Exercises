# Quanty-Exercises

binomialtree2.xlsx : just a combination of the tutorial found [here](https://www.macroption.com/binomial-trees-excel/) and Steven Shreve's Stochastic Calculus for Finance I, Chapter 1. <br>
binomialtree.ipynb: did the same exercise in Jupyter Notebook for fun <br>
CAPM.ipynb: simple linear regression used to derive the slope (beta value) of a capital asset pricing model for Google stock.
